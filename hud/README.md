# This is googHUD! A hud designed for Team Fortress 2, specifically with competitive in mind to give the most important information to the player without overbearing them. The idea is to be simplistic but clean. 

To install, press the green "Code" on github, then download ZIP. Once downloaded, open/unzip the file and drag the folder "googhud-main" into \Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

Currently 1.0 release. This is the full release! If you do encounter any bugs, be sure to reach out via discord or through the github issues section.

Thanks to the following folks who I borrowed hud elements from:

- cibacity - cibahud (base)
- static - voidhud
- nokk - ahud
- quickkennedy - cutehud
- peaches - xhud
- mrcolour - colourhud
- whisker - budhud

TO DO:
- customization options
- win panel overhaul
- better compatability for the unpopular gamemodes
- main menu customization panel additions
- bug fixes

I've been working on this by myself but if anyone is interested in helping out or even providing feedback, I'd really appreciate it! my discord is greysucks
